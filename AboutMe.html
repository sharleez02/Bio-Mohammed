   	Since we have our daughter, I <a href="http://www.clker.com/cliparts/D/3/A/R/q/k/red-heart-hi.png">love</a> to spent time with her as much as I can whenever I can. One of my other passion is <a href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3392/3228443616_67e28fdef7.jpg">drowing</a> and <a href="https://afremov.com/image.php?type=P&id=17833">painting</a>, this is something I taught myself and enjoy very much to do. I also find <a href="http://www.china-family-adventure.com/image-files/cooking-with-a-wok-stir-frying.jpg">cooking</a> very enjoying. Its like art insted of paint I have to figure out the balance of <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRQvUi9vPxwrRJ5c_-7pIXTZbn9tCNjjVCVKxomRnPzd33Ifckp">spice</a> and flavor.
